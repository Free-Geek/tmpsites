## What

`tmpsites` is a tool for creating temporary, disposable web hosting accounts.
It is useful for a classroom situation, such as when teaching the basics of web development.

Each web account has a hostname, SFTP access, and a generated password.
Accounts are automatically deleted after 3 hours or a configurable timeframe.

The tool consists of client-side commands and server code.
Everything is controlled from the client-side commands.
The client commands have been tested on macOS 10.12.
The server code has been tested on an Amazon EC2 "micro" instance with Ubuntu 16.04.

## How it works

1. The `client/provision` command provisions a server with the necessary base software and configuration.
2. The `client/add_accounts` command creates user accounts and corresponding web configurations.
  Then it prints the usernames and their generated passwords for distribution.

The usernames of the accounts created will have the form "siteN", where N is a number
starting from 1. For example: `site1`, `site2`, `site3`.

The web virtual hosts will be configured with the hostname "siteN.example.com",
corresponding to each user account. For example: `site1.example.com`, `site2.example.com`,
`site3.example.com`.

## Instructions

### Clone this repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/moxley/tmpsites.git
cd tmpsites
```

### Using Amazon EC2

Amazon EC2 is the only tested provider at this time. Other providers may work too (see below).

Create an AWS account if one is not yet created.

#### Detailed Instructions for Creating an EC2 Instance

1. Open the AWS console.
2. Search or select the EC2 service.
3. Find and click the blue "Launch Instance" button, selecting "Launch Instance" from its dropdown.
4. From the list of operating systems, choose Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS
5. From the Instance Type page, choose "t2.micro", and click the "Next: Configure Instance Details" button.
6. Leave the default settings and click the "Next: Add Storage" button.
7. Leave the default settings and click the "Next: Add Tags" button.
8. Leave the default settings and click the "Next: Configure Security Group" button.
9. In the "Configure Security Group" page, ensure there is a rule for:
  * Type: SSH
  * Protocol: TCP
  * Port Range: 22
  * Source: Anywhere (leave the address with the default value)
10. Still on the "Configure Security Group" page, click "Add Rule", and set the rule up with the following settings:
  * Type: HTTP
  * Leave the remaining defaults as they are
11. Ignore the warnings about security.
12. Click "Review and Launch"
13. On the "Review Instance Launch" page, click "Launch".
14. In the pop-up window, select "Create a new key pair", and give it a name.
15. Click "Download Key Pair".
16. Save the file to the folder that has this readme file, and name it `private_key`.
17. Click "Launch Instances".

### DNS Configuration

You will need to configure DNS entries for every hostname you expect to use.
Let's say you have 6 students in a class, and you want to provide a hosting
account for each. You'll generate accounts and web configurations that will
support hostnames like this:

* site1.example.com
* site2.example.com
* site3.example.com
* site4.example.com
* site5.example.com
* site6.example.com

You'll need to log into your DNS provider, which will either be your domain provider,
or your web hosting provider, and configure the DNS entries for the domain name
you're going to use.

It's probably best set it up this way:

1. Create one 'A' record that acts as an anchor for all the sites, site1 through siteN:
  * Host: site.example.com
  * IP Address: (your server IP address)
2. For each of the site hostnames, create a CNAME record:
  * Host: siteN (where N is a number starting from 1)
  * Points to: site.example.com

The advantage to using CNAME records is if you switch to
a different server with a different IP address, you only
need to change the one 'A' record.

### Configure

Copy the file `config.sample` to `config`:

```shell
cp config.sample config
```

Edit the file and change the settings:

`root_hostname`: Let's say the site hostnames are `site1.example.com`, `site2.example.com`, `site3.example.com`, etc. The `root_hostname`
would be `example.com`. Of course, you will need to have `example.com` registered.

`ssh_remote`: This is the server's admin username and server's default hostname,
joined with a '@'. This is used as part of an SSH command or Rsync.

`num_accounts`: This is the number of web accounts to create.

`accounts_ttl`: Amount of time the website accounts have to live. The format of this setting
is exactly the format used in the `date` command to calculate date arithmetic.

### Provision the server

Run the following:

```shell
client/provision
```

This installs the dependencies, such as
[nginx](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/)
and [mysecureshell](https://mysecureshell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
and configures them.

It also installs a [crontab](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/ucrontab.htm) command that regularly checks for web hosting
accounts that have expired, and it deletes them.

### Add web accounts

Run the following:

```shell
client/add_accounts
```

The above command adds sites to the server. The number of sites is
dependent on `num_accounts`, in the `config` file.

Now visit: `site1.example.com`, or whatever your first site is called.

You should see a webpage with the words "Welcome to site1.example.com!".
If instead you see something like "This site canâ€™t be reached", it either means
the DNS configuration hasn't propagated yet, or it is configured incorrectly.
If it hasn't propagated, you'll have to wait for it to finish.

If there were sites already created before, they will be deleted to make
way for the new ones.

### Remove web accounts

The web accounts will be removed automatically, after 3 hours, or after whatever `accounts_ttl` is set to, but if you
would like to remove them right away, run this:

```shell
client/remove_accounts
```
